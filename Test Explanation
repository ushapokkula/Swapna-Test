The feature runs using InternetExplorer driver on IE browser, as there is a compatability issue in the application. 
The application doesn't login in Firefox and Chrome

1. Application doesn't login in Chrom and Firefox browsers
2. Phone number field also accepts alphabets
3. Some times the login fails on IE browser also.
